Thank you for checking out the pcilookup.com source code!

As a side note, I will be running some analytics on the site for a while to make sure it is performing as expected (as far as load times go).
Those analytics will be done using Piwik (https://piwik.org/) hosted on my secondary VPS. It is configured to only store the first 2 octets of a visitors IP address, and it respects Do Not Track settings, because we value privacy as much as you do. All of the data is stored locally, under my full control, and never shared with anyone. Ever. I will likely take the analytics down after a month or 2 while we make some changes to the site.

If there are any complaints regarding this matter I am open to hearing them.

Please feel free to fork and make it better! 

I know the API code is a little strange (looks like PHP in style because that's what I know)!

The web front end is in pci-web and the API backend is in pci.
